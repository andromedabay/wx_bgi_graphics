/**
 * @file bgi_overlay.h
 * @brief Internal declarations for the visual overlay system.
 *
 * Visual overlays are non-DDS, non-selectable rendering aids drawn fresh every
 * frame.  They are not serialised to DDJ/DDY and cannot be picked by the
 * selection cursor.
 *
 * **Grid and UCS axes** are global (visible in every camera viewport when
 * enabled) and are drawn by @c drawOverlaysForCamera(), which is called from
 * @c wxbgi_render_dds() after the DDS scene traversal and before
 * @c flushToScreen().
 *
 * **Concentric circles + crosshair** are per-camera and are also drawn by
 * @c drawOverlaysForCamera().
 *
 * **Selection cursor square** is drawn as an OpenGL @c GL_LINE_LOOP by
 * @c drawSelectionCursorsGL(), which is called from @c flushToScreen() after
 * the pixel-buffer rendering pass and before @c glFlush(), so it always
 * appears on top of everything else.
