# Drawing Description Data Structure (DDS)

## Acronym Glossary

| Acronym | Expanded Form | Meaning |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **DDS** | Drawing Description Data Structure | The in-memory retained-mode scene graph that holds every drawing object created during a session. |
| **DDDS** | Drawing Description Data Structure (alternative form) | Interchangeable with DDS -- used in early design notes; the shorter form **DDS** is preferred in code and API names. |
| **CHDOP** | Class Hierarchy of Drawing Object Primitives | The C++ class/struct hierarchy that represents individual objects stored inside the DDS (points, lines, circles, cameras, UCS frames, 3D solids, etc.). |
| **DDJ** | Drawing Data JSON | A JSON-format serialisation of the full DDS scene, produced by `wxbgi_dds_to_json()` and consumed by `wxbgi_dds_from_json()`. |
| **DDY** | Drawing Data YAML | A YAML-format serialisation of the full DDS scene, produced by `wxbgi_dds_to_yaml()` and consumed by `wxbgi_dds_from_yaml()`. |

These acronyms appear throughout API function names (e.g. `wxbgi_dds_*`), internal type names, and code comments.

## What the DDS Adds

Every call to a BGI drawing function (e.g. `line`, `circle`, `rectangle`) and every world/UCS draw call (e.g. `wxbgi_world_line`, `wxbgi_ucs_circle`) **automatically appends a CHDOP entry** to the DDS while also performing the immediate pixel-buffer render. The DDS therefore always contains a complete, replayable description of the current scene.

Cameras (`wxbgi_cam_*` / `wxbgi_cam2d_*`), User Coordinate Systems (`wxbgi_ucs_*`), world extents, and 3D solid primitives are also stored as CHDOP nodes in the DDS.

Key design choices:

- **Collection:** `std::unordered_map` (O(1) direct access by string ID) combined with a `std::vector` insertion-order index -- giving both quick direct access and sequential traversal.
- **Default scene:** A default camera named `"default"` and a world UCS named `"world"` are created automatically on `initwindow()` / `initgraph()`.
- **Retained-mode render:** Call `wxbgi_render_dds(camName)` to replay the full scene through any camera. All three panels of the camera demo use this to show the same DDS from different viewpoints simultaneously.
- **Serialisation:** The scene can be exported to DDJ or DDY at any time and re-imported to restore or share it.

## Retained Composition Nodes

The DDS/CHDOP graph now supports a small retained composition layer on top of
leaf primitives:

- **Transform** nodes reference one or more child IDs and carry a 4x4 affine
  matrix. Public helpers include translate, rotate, scale, and skew wrappers.
- **SetUnion**, **SetIntersection**, and **SetDifference** nodes reference
  existing DDS object IDs and render them as a single composed result.
- **SetDifference** is ordered: operand 0 is the base, operands 1..N are
  subtracted from it in sequence.
- For supported 3D solid DDS leaves (`Box`, `Sphere`, `Cylinder`, `Cone`,
  `Torus`, `HeightMap`, `ParamSurface`, `Extrusion`), retained **union**,
  **intersection**, and **difference** are currently evaluated via the exact
  Manifold-based boolean path before rendering.

These nodes are first-class DDS entries: they have their own IDs, participate in
JSON/YAML serialisation, can be hidden or labelled, and can themselves be
referenced by later composition nodes.

The exact retained boolean backend stays on Manifold in this library. Supported
3D solids are converted into closed volumes before boolean evaluation, and the
resulting mesh is cached per DDS scene revision for efficient redraws.

### Current status

- Public affine helpers today: **translate**, **rotate**, **scale**, and **skew**
- Public retained set operations today: **union**, **intersection**, **difference**
- Render ownership is enforced by DDS traversal: an object referenced by a `Transform`, `SetUnion`, `SetIntersection`, or `SetDifference` is skipped as a standalone render root and is expected to appear through its owning composed node
- Supported 3D solids use the exact Manifold boolean path; unsupported analytic cases fall back to closed triangle meshes before boolean evaluation
- `wxbgi_dds_set_solid_draw_mode(...)` propagates draw-mode changes to both leaf solids and retained set-operation nodes
- Full retained transform chains now accumulate the entire 4x4 matrix during replay and exact 3D boolean evaluation; translation is no longer a special-case fast path only

### High-level implementation design

1. Leaf primitives are stored in `DdsScene::index` / `order` like any other DDS object.
2. `Transform` and `Set*` nodes store only referenced child IDs plus node-local state (style, matrix, draw mode, labels, visibility).
3. `DdsScene::forEachRenderRoot()` computes which IDs are referenced by composition nodes and suppresses those IDs as top-level roots during `wxbgi_render_dds(...)`.
4. `renderNodeRecursive(...)` traverses from each render root. Leaf objects render directly; transform nodes post-multiply their local matrix into the accumulated chain; set-operation nodes evaluate or mask-combine their operands.
5. For supported 3D solids, `renderExactSetOperation3D(...)` evaluates a closed-volume Manifold result, caches the generated triangles per DDS scene revision, and replays that cached mesh on later frames.

### Safe usage note for DDS IDs

Getter functions such as `wxbgi_dds_get_id_at(...)` return borrowed `const char *`
buffers. In C++ code, copy them immediately:

```cpp
const std::string id = wxbgi_dds_get_id_at(wxbgi_dds_object_count() - 1);
```

That avoids later DDS API calls overwriting the buffer before you build a
transform or set-operation node.

### Retained composition example

```cpp
wxbgi_solid_sphere(38.f, 95.f, 0.f, 12.f, sphSl, sphSt);
const std::string sphereId = wxbgi_dds_get_id_at(wxbgi_dds_object_count() - 1);

wxbgi_solid_torus(42.f, 95.f, 2.f, 10.f, 4.5f, torTu, torSi);
const std::string torusId = wxbgi_dds_get_id_at(wxbgi_dds_object_count() - 1);

const char *ops[2] = { sphereId.c_str(), torusId.c_str() };
const std::string diffId = wxbgi_dds_difference(2, ops);
wxbgi_dds_set_label(diffId.c_str(), "sphere-torus-diff");
```

## DDS External Attributes

Each DDS object now carries a generic `externalAttributes` string map. This is
intended for workflows that need to attach extra semantic information without
changing the core geometry model. The first consumer is the OpenLB bridge, but
the storage is deliberately generic.

Typical OpenLB-facing keys include:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `openlb.role` | semantic role such as `fluid`, `solid`, or `boundary` |
| `openlb.material` | explicit material id stored as a string |
| `openlb.boundary` | boundary classification such as `wall` or `inlet` |
| `openlb.priority` | overlap tie-breaker for classification |
| `openlb.enabled` | on-off export flag |

These attributes round-trip through both DDJ and DDY serialisation.

## DDS as OpenLB Geometry Source

The retained DDS scene is now also used as the geometry source for an
OpenLB-oriented material-classification bridge. This is a geometry query layer,
not a solver ABI.

Current exported helpers live in `src/wx_bgi_openlb.h`:

- `wxbgi_openlb_classify_point_material(...)`
- `wxbgi_openlb_sample_materials_2d(...)`

Current supported retained subset:

- box
- sphere
- cylinder
- cone
- torus
- transform chains
- set-union, set-intersection, and set-difference nodes

Unsupported DDS object types are currently treated as not contributing solver
occupancy. This keeps the bridge explicit and predictable while the supported
subset grows.

## Minimal DDS Usage Example

```c
#include "wx_bgi.h"
#include "wx_bgi_dds.h"
#include "wx_bgi_3d.h"

initwindow(800, 600, "DDS Demo", 0, 0, 1, 1);

// Classic BGI calls -- each one also writes a CHDOP entry to the DDS.
setcolor(WHITE);
circle(400, 300, 80);
rectangle(200, 150, 600, 450);

// Render the same scene through any named camera.
wxbgi_render_dds("default");

// Export to DDJ and DDY.
wxbgi_dds_save_json("scene.ddj");
wxbgi_dds_save_yaml("scene.ddy");

// Query the scene.
printf("Objects in DDS: %d\n", wxbgi_dds_object_count());

// Reload from JSON into a fresh session.
wxbgi_dds_clear();
wxbgi_dds_load_json("scene.ddj");
```

## GL Rendering Pipeline (wx Mode)

When using `wx_bgi_wx`, the BGI pixel buffer is composited to the screen via an
OpenGL texture quad pass rather than the legacy per-pixel `GL_POINTS` path.
The modern path is selected automatically when the driver supports **OpenGL 3.3**
(virtually all hardware since 2010).  On older drivers the library falls back
silently to the legacy path.

### Explicit GL Cleanup

When the application destroys its `wxGLContext`, call `wxbgi_gl_pass_destroy()`
**with the context still current** to release all internal GL objects (textures,
VAOs, shader programs).  Omitting this can cause GPU driver crashes during
process shutdown on some Windows configurations.

The `WxBgiCanvas` destructor handles this automatically, so user code only needs
this call when managing a custom `wxGLContext` lifecycle:

```cpp
// Custom GL context teardown -- make context current first.
canvas->SetCurrent(*myGlContext);
wxbgi_gl_pass_destroy();   // release VAOs, VBOs, textures, programs
delete myGlContext;
```

### Diagnostic: Legacy GL Fallback

Force the legacy `GL_POINTS` rendering path at runtime (useful for comparing
output or isolating GL driver issues):

```c
wxbgi_set_legacy_gl_render(1);   // 1 = legacy GL_POINTS, 0 = texture quad (default)
```

## 3D Solid Shading Modes and Lighting API

3D solid primitives support three draw modes and a GPU Phong-style lighting model.

### Draw Mode Constants

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `WXBGI_SOLID_WIREFRAME` | 0 | Edges only; current line colour; software painter's algorithm |
| `WXBGI_SOLID_SOLID` | 1 | Backward-compat alias for `WXBGI_SOLID_FLAT` |
| `WXBGI_SOLID_FLAT` | 1 | GL Phong flat shading with GPU depth buffer — per-face normals, sharp silhouette |
| `WXBGI_SOLID_SMOOTH` | 2 | GL Phong smooth (Gouraud) shading — per-vertex normals averaged from adjacent faces |

`WXBGI_SOLID_FLAT` and `WXBGI_SOLID_SMOOTH` use the full GPU pipeline:
- Triangle data is tessellated in world-space and collected into a `PendingGlRender` buffer.
- `wxbgi_render_dds()` / `wxbgi_wx_render_page_gl()` submits the buffer to the GPU as a VBO.
- **Layer 0**: 2D page buffer uploaded as an RGBA texture (fullscreen quad).
- **Layer 1**: Solid triangles drawn with GLSL Phong shading + `GL_DEPTH_TEST`.
- **Layer 2**: World-space line segments drawn depth-tested (if any present).
- Wireframe solids fall back to the software painter's algorithm (fast, no depth buffer).

### Lighting API (`wx_bgi_dds.h`)

These functions configure the Phong lighting model used when `WXBGI_SOLID_FLAT`
or `WXBGI_SOLID_SMOOTH` is active.  Parameters are stored in `BgiState::lightState`
and applied each frame by the GPU solid render pass.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `wxbgi_solid_set_light_dir(x, y, z)` | Primary (key) light direction vector (will be normalised). |
| `wxbgi_solid_set_light_space(worldSpace)` | `1` = light direction in world space; `0` = view/eye space. |
| `wxbgi_solid_set_fill_light(x, y, z, strength)` | Secondary fill light direction + intensity scalar. |
| `wxbgi_solid_set_ambient(a)` | Ambient light intensity `[0..1]`. |
| `wxbgi_solid_set_diffuse(d)` | Diffuse reflection coefficient `[0..1]`. |
| `wxbgi_solid_set_specular(s, shininess)` | Specular intensity and Phong shininess exponent. |
| `wxbgi_set_legacy_gl_render(enable)` | `1` = revert to the old per-pixel `GL_POINTS` path (diagnostics only). |

Default lighting:
- Key light: `(-0.577, 0.577, 0.577)` world-space (upper-left-front).
- Fill light: `(0, -1, 0)` at strength `0.3`.
- Ambient `0.2`, diffuse `0.7`, specular `0.3` / shininess `32`.

### Smooth-Shading Vertex Normal Algorithm

`WXBGI_SOLID_SMOOTH` computes per-vertex normals using an accumulate-and-normalise
approach over the tessellated triangle list:
1. Compute the face normal for every triangle.
2. For each vertex, sum the face normals of all triangles that share that position
   (quantised to 1/1000-world-unit grid to handle float precision).
3. Normalise each accumulated normal.

This produces smooth curvature on spheres and cylinders while preserving hard edges
on box corners where the shared-vertex map has no neighbours.

## Multi-Scene Management (CHDOP Graph Registry)

### Overview

The library maintains a **registry of named DDS / CHDOP graphs**.  Each graph is
an independent retained-mode scene.  A scene named `"default"` always exists and
cannot be destroyed — backward-compatible code that never calls any
`wxbgi_dds_scene_*` function continues to work exactly as before.

### Two Key Relationships

#### 1 Scene → Many Cameras

Multiple cameras can be assigned to the same scene graph.  All of them will render
the same set of objects from their own viewpoint:

```
Scene "main"  -->  cam_a (top-left perspective)
              -->  cam_b (top-right orthographic)
```

This is the primary use-case for split-view CAD / engineering visualisations.

#### 1 Camera → 1 Scene (exclusive)

Each camera is assigned to exactly one scene at a time.  Changing the assignment
with `wxbgi_cam_set_scene()` is immediate — the next `wxbgi_render_dds(camName)`
call uses the new scene.  If the previously assigned scene is destroyed, the
camera automatically falls back to `"default"`.

```
cam_a --> "main"       (changed via wxbgi_cam_set_scene("cam_a","main"))
cam_b --> "main"
cam_c --> "secondary"  (different object graph entirely)
```

### Scene Management API (`wx_bgi_dds.h`)

| Function | Returns | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `wxbgi_dds_scene_create(name)` | `int` 0=ok / -1 | Create a new named scene.  No-op if `name` already exists. |
| `wxbgi_dds_scene_destroy(name)` | `void` | Destroy a named scene; cameras assigned to it fall back to `"default"`.  No-op on `"default"`. |
| `wxbgi_dds_scene_set_active(name)` | `void` | Route all subsequent immediate-mode draw calls to this scene. |
| `wxbgi_dds_scene_get_active()` | `const char *` | Return the name of the currently active scene. |
| `wxbgi_dds_scene_exists(name)` | `int` 1=yes / 0 | Test whether a named scene exists in the registry. |
| `wxbgi_dds_scene_clear(name)` | `void` | Remove all drawing objects from the named scene; cameras and UCS in that scene are kept. |
| `wxbgi_dds_scene_clear_active()` | `void` | Same as above for the currently active scene. |

### Camera-to-Scene Assignment API (`wx_bgi_dds.h`)

| Function | Returns | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `wxbgi_cam_set_scene(camName, sceneName)` | `void` | Assign a camera to a named scene.  Pass `NULL` as `camName` for the active camera. |
| `wxbgi_cam_get_scene(camName)` | `const char *` | Return the scene name currently assigned to `camName`. |

### Per-Camera Shading Modes

When multiple cameras share a scene you will often want different shading per
camera (e.g. camera A in Smooth, camera B in Wireframe).  Call
`wxbgi_dds_set_solid_draw_mode()` immediately before each `wxbgi_render_dds()`
call to apply a per-camera draw mode without permanently changing the DDS:

```c
// Camera A — smooth shading
wxbgi_dds_set_solid_draw_mode(WXBGI_SOLID_SMOOTH);
wxbgi_render_dds("cam_a");

// Camera B — wireframe
wxbgi_dds_set_solid_draw_mode(WXBGI_SOLID_WIREFRAME);
wxbgi_render_dds("cam_b");
```

### Multi-Scene Usage Example

```c
#include "wx_bgi.h"
#include "wx_bgi_dds.h"
#include "wx_bgi_3d.h"

initwindow(1200, 600, "Multi-Scene Demo", 0, 0, 1, 1);

// --- Create two named scenes -------------------------------------------------
wxbgi_dds_scene_create("main");
wxbgi_dds_scene_create("secondary");

// --- Populate "main" scene ---------------------------------------------------
wxbgi_dds_scene_set_active("main");
setcolor(CYAN);
wxbgi_solid_sphere(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 24, 24, WXBGI_SOLID_SMOOTH);
setcolor(YELLOW);
wxbgi_solid_box(-3.0f, -0.5f, -0.5f, -1.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, WXBGI_SOLID_FLAT);

// --- Populate "secondary" scene ----------------------------------------------
wxbgi_dds_scene_set_active("secondary");
setcolor(MAGENTA);
wxbgi_solid_torus(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.2f, 0.4f, 32, 16, WXBGI_SOLID_SMOOTH);
setcolor(GREEN);
wxbgi_world_line(0,0,0, 2,0,0);
wxbgi_world_line(0,0,0, 0,2,0);

// --- Create cameras and assign scenes ----------------------------------------
wxbgi_cam_create("cam_a");
wxbgi_cam_create("cam_b");
wxbgi_cam_create("cam_c");
wxbgi_cam_set_scene("cam_a", "main");       // cam_a and cam_b both see "main"
wxbgi_cam_set_scene("cam_b", "main");
wxbgi_cam_set_scene("cam_c", "secondary");  // cam_c sees a different graph

// Set viewports and positions ...

// --- Render each camera independently ----------------------------------------
// Both cam_a and cam_b show the same sphere + box from different angles:
wxbgi_dds_set_solid_draw_mode(WXBGI_SOLID_SMOOTH);
wxbgi_render_dds("cam_a");

wxbgi_dds_set_solid_draw_mode(WXBGI_SOLID_WIREFRAME);
wxbgi_render_dds("cam_b");

// cam_c shows only the torus + lines:
wxbgi_dds_set_solid_draw_mode(WXBGI_SOLID_SMOOTH);
wxbgi_render_dds("cam_c");

// --- Round-trip: DDJ serialisation preserves scene assignments ---------------
wxbgi_dds_save_json("multi_scene.ddj");   // serialises registry + camera assignments
wxbgi_dds_load_json("multi_scene.ddj");   // restores all scenes + assignments
```

### Serialisation Notes

DDJ/DDY files produced by `wxbgi_dds_save_json()` and `wxbgi_dds_save_yaml()` now
include a `"scenes"` top-level key that lists every named scene graph, and each
camera node carries a `"scene"` field recording its `assignedSceneName`.

**Backward compatibility:** Old DDJ/DDY files that do not have a `"scenes"` key
load cleanly — all objects are placed into the `"default"` scene and all cameras
are assigned to `"default"`.
